WatchMe is a movie listing website developed on RocketSeat's Ignite Bootcamp.

# Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project must be built with npm, so download it below if you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

To run this server you will need a node version 12.0.0 (minimum)
